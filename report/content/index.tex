\chapter{Index}
In this chapter an explanation of the index page (front page)  and the different thought and actions taken with it will be described.  
\section{Design Ideas}
The website is primarily to be used by a non-technical person at AU-Herning. The design has been kept clean to make it very intuitive how to navigate around. Periodically the energy system (and thereby also the website) is shown for high-schools students visiting the school, therefore the index page has been build up with mostly icons instead of text and a navigation bar which some of them might know from OS X (from Apple). The customer wanted the production shown as primitive things like: lightbulbs, refrigerators, money (possibly shown as number of SU payments), instead of technical terms like Joule, kW, kWh etc.
