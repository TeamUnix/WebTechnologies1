\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this course has been to create a website with several pages written in 'XHTML strict', which should be used for the energy system developed in PRO3 and PRO4 by the E10 class. The website should be designed from scratch without any use of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tools. All pictures used should be scaled in Photoshop (or similar tool) to fit on the site. \\The written report contains the thoughts behind the site, together with an explanation about the HTML coding in general. The report also contains pieces of code from the site and information about why the different steps have been taken. \\
\\
The report is divided into 3 major sections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Index: designing the front page.
	\item Module: designing the module page, used by all groups.
	\item Optimizing the website for small screen devices.
\end{itemize}
Each person in the group is responsible for one of the above section:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Platform+Index: Dennis
	\item Module: Theis.
	\item Small screen optimisation: Paulo
\end{itemize}
