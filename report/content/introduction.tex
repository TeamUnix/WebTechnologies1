\chapter{Introduction}
The goal has been to create a website with several pages. The website should be designed from scratch without the use of any WYSIWYG tools. All pictures used should be scaled in Photoshop (or similar tool) to fit on the site. The report written contains the thoughts behind the site together with explanation about HTML coding in general and pieces of code from the site together with some information about why the different steps have been done. 
The report is divided into 3 major sections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Index: designing the front page
	\item Module: designing the module page used by all groups
	\item Optimizing the website for small screen devices.
\end{itemize}
Each person in the group is responsible for one of the above section:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Platform+Index: Dennis
	\item Module: Theis
	\item Small screen optimization: Paulo
\end{itemize}
