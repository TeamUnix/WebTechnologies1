\chapter{Conclusion}
Both the normal site and the mobile site validates without errors or warnings using the w3 validator. 
\\\\XHTML Validation: \textit{http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http\%3A\%2F\%2Fehub.threee.dk\%2F}
\\Mobile Validation: \textit{http://validator.w3.org/mobile/?async=false\&docAddr=http://ehub.threee.dk/mobile/}
\\CSS Validation: \textit{http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=ehub.threee.dk&profile=css3}
\\\\So far the content of the website is kept on a minimum where only design and navigation are implemented. The next step in getting a fully functional website for the energy system is to implement PHP scripts to make details as logging into the system, start and stop modules etc.
\\In the development of the website theory from the WEB1 classes have been used to code and design it all.
